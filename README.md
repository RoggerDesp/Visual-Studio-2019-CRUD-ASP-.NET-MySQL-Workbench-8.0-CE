This is a practice to upload, delete, search, and modify the items currently written in the text boxes of 3 different tables in a database. The program was developed in Visual Studio (Visual Basic) and I used MYSQL Workbench for the database.

Medica.sql is the archive you will need to import to MySQL Worckbench

SegundoDepartamentalEq3.sln is the one you will need to open with Visual Studio ( with the Visual Basic tool).
